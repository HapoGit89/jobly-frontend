Jobly - Frontend

Live at: https://jobly-hapo.surge.sh/

This App was part if my curriculum at Springboard. While I used a given backend fir this frontend, you can find my own backend version at: https://github.com/HapoGit89/jobly-backend.git

The Jobly app is a job search Platform with following features:

- Search for Companies and available Jobs
- SignUp and create/edit User Profile
- Apply For Jobs

The Frontend was built using React and Reactstrap.
